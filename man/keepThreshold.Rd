\usage{
keepThreshold(subcascades = NULL, thresh = 0, comparison = ">=")
}
\arguments{
\item{subcascades}{A Subcascades object as it is returned by \code{\link{subcascades}}-function.
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices.
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1>2>3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.}

\item{thresh}{A numeric value between 0 and 1.
The minimal sensitivity threshold used to filter the returned cascades.
Only cascades that pass this threshold are returned.
If 0 is used the returned cascades are filtered for >0 and otherwise >= thresh.
For low thresholds the calculation lasts longer.}

\item{comparison}{Defines the comparison type (<,>,<=,>=) for the threshold.}
}
\value{
A Subcascades object comprising the evaluated cascades and their performances.
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices.
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1>2>3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.
}
\description{
Filters for all cascades that match the comparison with a minimal classwise sensitivity threshold.
